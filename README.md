# Smart-Traffic-Controller
This project implements a Smart Traffic Controller responsible for coordinating vehicle signals, pedestrian crossings, and timing logic for a smart traffic light system.  The solution is developed using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, ensuring all functionality is specified, verified, and validated through automated unit tests.
